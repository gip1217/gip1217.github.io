    <h3>Article about ICT and the field of work</h3>
       <h4>Exploring the HBO-ICT Program at HZ University of Applied Sciences: Opportunities and Career Paths</h4> 
    <p>
      One of the ICT field of work or expertise would be UX Design or anything related to UX or even Agile. Both of those two topics are dear to me and I care to continuous learn about them hence I've already invested quite a bit of time to get more familiar with these topics.
      UX is part of web, applications and everything we touch or use everyday. 
      UX is part of our life regardless of age, location or if we are deep into internet usage or social media. But for ICT purpose I will debate about the impact UX had/has on the web development.
      If we are talking about Web or just an Application, desktop format or Ipad or just a smartphone the web page or application must be responsive, as readable as possible, adjusted to the target audience, must have most probably a version dedicated to people having 
      impairment.
      <br> </br>
      Besides being responsive, it must meet features and content and be organized and parsed in ways that makes it easy and interesting for the end user. 
      Nielsen Norman in his book " The Design of Everyday Things "( a book that's been already revised with more up to date examples) is talking about the 'user' mindlessly using a certain object or a web without needing to read a single line on how to use it.This is how he defines a good design. And I personally, couldn't agree more.
      Navigating on a web page without being disturbed by unecessary information, harassed by loads of desgin patterns, get a clear and clean site/application is within the best practices for a good web-design/er. 
      <br></br>
      Moreover, I think is worth mentioning that all of this is possible if at programming level the requirements are well set and explained from the bery beginner by the stakeholders. The developers/programmers need to understand the purpose of what they are developing and how this will impact or what will be delivered through the application or the web. 
      The UX has multiple phases and iteration till the end result will be translated into final product. Customer journey, Ideation, Defining Personas, Prototyping, Research Methods, User Testing and so on, are just few methods that UX is using to create or to attempt creating the best end-product. 
      I am looking forward to navigate through this topic at a more deeper level once my agenda gets a bit more space. And I will for sure come back to this semi-article to give more information of what I've been discovering but meanwhile, feel free to reach out to  <a href = "https://www.nngroup.com/videos/biggest-mistake-writing-web/ " target="blank">this video/article.</a>

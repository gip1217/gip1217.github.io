    <p>Throughout the PCO class we are meant to develop a website that will eventually tackle few requirements. Based on the work done we needed to complete a full functional website which will be fully delivered by 18th of October while presenting it in front of one of the chosen Lecturers.
      <br></br> 
    Meanwhile, as a aiding step, we had a short mock-up presentation that took place in September marking somewhat a milestone in the website development. While this presentation we had the chance to have a short overview and feedback session where the lecturer graciously shared few items that could be improved so that the end result would be fully functional and as well representing each one of us.
    During my feedback session I've received the following items to work on and improve them till final presentation. See the list below:
    <ul>
      <li>Rename classes so that is easy to understand, easy to figure what's the styling refering to and mostly to be easy to maintaint</li>
      <li>Maintain the same UI and UX throughtout the entire website so it doesn't confuse the user and as well keeping a good identify of the author of the site</li>
      <li>Resize the images so they fit</li>
      <li>Rename all the images to a clear naming convention</li>
      <li>Replace the backgroun for  "Profile" page so that is more readable</li>
    </ul>
    What I did?
    <ul>
      <li>Rename all classes for easy maintainability </li>
      <li>Remove  "Categorie" from Blog as they were unecessary as as well been advised during feedback session to do so</li>
      <li>Add new backgroun witch is now across the entire website so in terms of UX/UI it is easy to follow</li>
      <li>Add all FAQ required</li>
      <li>Create the Aside menu</li>
      <li>Added a profile picture into "Profile" page</li>
      <li>Created a "Return-to-Blog" button for each page in the Blog</li>
    </ul>

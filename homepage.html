    <h2>Why HBO-ITC?</h2>
    <p>I am not new to IT domain as I gathered a bit of experience as IT Project Manager and later stage as Scrum Master.
        My most recent project was one of the most interesting I've worked for so far. Here's why. 
        Probably you've heard about Vodafone( Ziggo) which made a quite interesting deal with Oracle and together they've created a platfor simulating the one from Azure or if you want the famous Cloud.
        To break it down for you, I would manage few multicultural teams, quite a challange due to timezone :P, in order to deliver successfully migrations of databases from onprem to OCI (Oracle cloud infrastrucure)
        But in order to be better while doing my job and get a deeper understanding of what the teams are doing around me I need a bit of ground work hence the reason why I've joined the program.

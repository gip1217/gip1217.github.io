<h2>A little bit about myself</h2>
   <p>I am not new to the IT field, having gained experience as an IT Project Manager and later as a Scrum Master. 
      One of the most exciting projects I've been part of recently involved a collaboration between Vodafone (Ziggo) and Oracle. 
      They developed a platform similar to Azure, essentially creating their own cloud infrastructure. My role was to manage several multicultural teams, which presented challenges, particularly with time zone differences. 
      We successfully delivered database migrations from on-premises systems to OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure). 
      To enhance my skills and gain a deeper understanding of the technical aspects my teams are working on, I joined this program for additional foundational knowledge.

<h2>Why HBO-ICT?</h2>
<p>I learned about <a href="https://www.hz.nl" class="uni-site">HZ University of Applied Sciences</a> through friends, and while exploring the website, I discovered the <a href="https://hz.nl/en/study-programmes/it" class="ICT">ICT</a> program, which caught my interest.
 <br>
    Here are a few key aspects that captured my interest:
    <div class="orderedlist">
 <ol>
    <li>the program offers three different study tracks</li>
    <li>opportunity to learn a new language as an optional feature</li>
    <li>gain deeper understanding of Agile and other frameworks</li>
    <li>deeper understanding of programming languages</li>
    <li>expertiment on your own and put in place different techs to effectively understand how they work and what one can achieve.</li>

  <div>
  <p> As an IT Project Manager & Scrum Master Background I managed multicultural teams and led projects, providing strong foundational skills in project management and team collaboration.
    Worked closely with technical teams on complex projects such as database migrations to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), gaining exposure to cloud technologies and infrastructure management.
    <br></br>
    Recently engaged in further education to deepen my understanding of technical concepts and programming, aiming to bridge the gap between project management and hands-on technical expertise.
    Focused on improving skills in programming and technical architecture to become more proficient in understanding and guiding technical teams.
    Played a key role in coordinating cloud migration projects, giving you practical insights into modern technologies like Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and cloud computing in general.
    Though more involved in the management side, this experience allowed you to interact with technical aspects and familiarize yourself with cloud platforms.
    Eagerness to learn as I actively pursuing programming knowledge and technical proficiency through ongoing education and hands-on experience to further contribute to my career in IT.
    <br></br>
    Concluding, I don't necessarily own a degree nor a define expertise in programming. I am navigating throught the concepts as a novice can go about it and for instance I find it quite fascinating in terms of how it expands the thinking patterns and change everything once thought knew about its capabilities. 
    I am putting all the effort I can into this old-but-new path and I am more than eager and excited to see how this entire experience will shape me on personal and profressional level.
